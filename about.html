					<p><img src="images/chefs2.jpg" width="50%" height="30%" align="left" />Our bakery opens at 6 A.M. sharp. Our chefs start their day by making sure the cooking space is clean and safe. We sanitize the work environment and use fresh ingredients every day to ensure the food is top-quality. All of our products are baked fresh in the morning! But don't worry, our diligent staff will continue baking so there will always be enough food for everyone.</p>
					<p>If you are stopping by to grab a few desserts, feel free to say hi to our amazing team of chefs behind the counter! This cheers them up during the day!</p>
